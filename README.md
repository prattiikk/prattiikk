<div align="center"> <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/13HgwGsXF0aiGY/giphy.gif" width="400" alt="Me debugging at 3 AM"/> <p><i>Current mood: Fixing bugs I created yesterday</i></p> </div>

## What I'm about

Full Stack Developer who somehow convinced people I know what I'm doing. Based in Pune, probably drinking chai while you're reading this.

Currently building stuff with the MERN stack because apparently that's what pays the bills these days. Also dabbling in Go because someone said it was "fast" and I believed them.

## Tech I pretend to be good at

**Frontend:** React.js, Next.js, HTML/CSS (yes, I can center a div)  
**Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, Go  
**Database:** MongoDB, because SQL joins hurt my brain  
**Tools:** Git (git commit -m "fix stuff"), VS Code, Terminal, Coffee

## Current Projects

-   **Portfolio Website**: [pratik-cv.vercel.app](http://pratik-cv.vercel.app/) - My digital resume that took longer to build than my actual career
-   **Linktree Clone**: One page to rule all your links because apparently we needed another one
-   **Rizz API**: Adding "flair" to chat integrations (yes, that's actually what I called it)
-   **CLI-Senpai**: Generate Linux commands via CLI because typing `man` pages is so 2020
-   **terminal-notes**: Taking notes via SSH because apparently I enjoy making simple things complicated
-   **Local LLM Code Completion**: Locally running AI code completion that probably suggests the same bugs I'd write anyway

## Quick Stats

```
Lines of code written: Too many to count
Bugs created: Slightly more than lines of code
Stack Overflow visits: Daily
Imposter syndrome level: Maximum

```

## Where to find me

-   üíº Portfolio: [pratik-cv.vercel.app](http://pratik-cv.vercel.app/)
-   üìß Probably checking emails I should have replied to last week
